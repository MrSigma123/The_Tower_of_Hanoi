The project of the tower will be the star pattern with different colors per
layer. The colors will be implemented by using special ASCII codes. The colors
will be cycled in certain order after specific value to make the tower look
more appealing and clearer.

Below is the example of the tower star pattern:
 
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
   ***********
  *************
