/*
This program will visualize consol version of the Tower of Hanoi
The rings will be displayed as the asterisks patterns. So the tower
will be represented as two dimensional geometric figure.
The tower manuvering will be done by entering the source and destination
ring number. By this way the specific ring will be transfered to the
desired destination.
